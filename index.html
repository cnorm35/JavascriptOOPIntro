          ## Object Oriented Programming with Javascript
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## What is it?
          The basic idea behind Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is using
          objects to represent real world objects inside our programs.

          Objects can contain information and functionality related to the
          things we're trying to model.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Why do you want to use it?

          Objects can serve as a convienient way to serve as a blueprint and to
          share common data and functionality. You'll often see these types of
          objects referred to as a _Class_
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          In OOP, a class can _inherit_ data and attributes from another class.
          When a class inherits from another class we call it a _Child Class_
          and the Class that's providing the info the _Parent Class_


          The child class will have the same properties and method available as
          the parent class.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          With most OOP, when calling a method on an object, if there is no
          matching method, each parent class will be checked for a matching
          method

          class -> parent class -> parent class
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Why should you use OOP?
          
          Using inheritance allows us to break up or programs into smaller, more
          managable, testable chunks and helps to reduce duplication
        </section>

          # OOP with Javascript
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Now we know a little about `Objects`, let's see how to create one with
          Javascript

          ```js
            var myObject = {}
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Within our `Objects`, we have `properties` and `values`.
          Think of a property as a name or category for the information inside
          of `value`. We create our properties like:
          
          ```js
            var myObject = {
              myFirstProperty: "first property value",
              mySecodProperty: "second property value"
            }
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Generic examples are boring, so let's create an `Object` with some
          information about ourselves

          ```js
          var cody = {
            age: 31,
            profession: 'Software Developer',
            location: 'Denver, CO'
          }
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          To get the value of a property of an `Object`,
          we can use either _Dot Notation_ or _Bracket Notation_
          
          Dot Notation:     **`object.propertyName`**

          Bracket Notation:     **`object["propertyName"]`**
          
          <!-- call the property name on the Object -->
          <!-- (syntax highlighting looks like shit) -->
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Using dot and bracket notation:
          ```js
            cody.age
            31
            cody["age"]
            31
            cody.profession
            'Sofware Developer'
            cody["profession"]
            'Software Developer'
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          So far, we've beeen creating our objects using the **object literal
          notation**.

          We can also use what's called a **constructor**. 

          To create the same example from above, we can create a new Object
          using the new operator and the Object constructor

          ```js
          var cody = new Object();
          cody.age = 31
          cody.age
          31
          cody.profession = "Software Developer"
          cody.profession
          'Software Developer'
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          In the previous example we used a built in constructor called `Object`
          that Javascript provides us.
          This creates a new object with no properties or methods. 
          and set our properties one at a time.

          <!-- ```js -->
          <!--   var emptyObject = new Object(); -->
          <!--   Object.getOwnPropertyNames(emptyObject); -->
          <!--   (this might be too much?) -->
          <!--   [] -->
          <!-- ``` -->
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Setting these values one at a time gets old pretty quick.  Let's make
          our own constructor for a `Person`

          ```js
          function Person(age, profession) {
            this.age = age;
            this.profession = profession;
          }

          var rick = new Person(60, 'Scientist')
          rick.age
          60
          rick.profession
          'Scientist'
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          We dont have to rely only on the values passed to the constructor
          
          We can also set a default value for each new Object that is created with our
          constructor

          ```js
          function Person(age, profession) {
            this.age = age;
            this.profession = profession;
            this.school = "Turing School of Software and Design"
          }

          var john = new Person(28, "Baker");
          john.school
          "Turing School of Software and Design"
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          We're starting seeing the benefits ot Object Oriented
          Programming.  
          
          We're creating a default value we dont have to worry
          about setting across all of our objects.  
          
          We're not just limited to
          setting values for properties, we can also create methods in our
          constructor that will be available in new objects created from the
          constructor.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Constructor with method:
          ```js
          function Person(name, age, profession) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.profession = profession;
            this.school = "Turing School of Software and Design"
            this.bio = function() {
              console.log("My name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + "
              years old.  Right now I am a " + this.profession + ". I'm
              currently studying at " + this.school)
            }
          }

          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ```js
            var me = new Person("cody", 31, "software developer");
            // since we're calling a method, instead of retuning the value of a
            // property, don't forget to add the brackets to your method name
            me.bio();
            > "My name is cody and I am 31 years old.  
            Right now I am a software developer. I'm currently studying at 
            Turing School of Software and Design
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Objects are just another _type_ in Javascript the same way that
          Arrays, and Strings are.  Lets see what creating an Array filled with
          Objects looks like
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ```js
          var secondShift = new Array();
          var firstPerson = new Person("Mark", 25, "Accountant");
          var secondPerson = new Person("John", 28, "Real Estate Agent");
          var thirdPerson = new Person("David", 30, "Loan Officer")
          
          secondShift.push(firstPerson, secondPerson, thirdPerson)
          ```

          Let's take a look at our array filled with Person objects...
          ```js
          for(i=0; i < secondShift.length, i++) {
            console.log(secondShift[i])
          }
          ```
          
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Since Objects are just another _type_ we can also use them as
          parameters for our functions


          ```js
            var sortPersonNames = function(person1, person2) {
              var names = [person1.name, person2.name]
              var sortedNames = names.sort();
              console.log(sortedNames[0] + " is first in alphabetical order")
            }
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Each one of the constructors we've created holds the data and methods
          available to objects created from that constructor.  In OOP, this is
          what we call a _Class_ .  When we created a constructor, we're
          creating a _prototype_ in Javascript.  Think of the prototype as the
          blueprint we use to create Objects.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Take a look at how we can define methods on an Object we've created

          ```js
          firstPerson.upperCaseName = function(){
            console.log(this.name.toUpperCase());
          }
          ```

          if we try to call the method we just created on another object created
          from our Person prototype, we'll get an error saying the function
          isn't defined.  

          This is pretty inconvenient and causes a lot of duplication in our code.  
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          It doesn't have to be this way.  We can define methods on our
          _prototype_ that will be available to all objects created with the
          prototype.  

          ```js
            Person.prototype.upperCaseName = function() {
              console.log(this.name.toUpperCase());
            }
          ```

          Now, all objects already created, and all objects that will be created
          in the future from our Person class will have the
          `upperCaseName` method available to them.
